# Projects

Have work projects and personal projects. Work projects have no PII or data from their networks. Personal projects are for educational use only

## Work

Started learning powershell and set up a script to create a new user and password and add them to the domain. Allows for multiple users to be set up.
[Link for new user script](./painlessemu/work/blob/main/NewUser)

## Personal

// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
